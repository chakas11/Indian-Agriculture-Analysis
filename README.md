# Indian-Agriculture-Analysis

I'll explore year- and district-specific statistics, examining specifics about crops, their geographic areas, yields, and production in various districts and years. The goal of using Power BI is to provide interactive visualizations that reveal discrepancies, trends, and patterns in agricultural operations. Thanks to Mentorness for giving me this opportunity to do an analysis.ðŸŒ±
